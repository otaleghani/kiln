# Clean Command

The `clean` command is a utility designed to completely remove the output directory generated by Kiln.

This is primarily used to ensure a "fresh" build. If you delete or rename a note in your vault, the old HTML file might remain in your output folder if you only overwrite files. Running `clean` ensures that the folder contains *only* the current state of your vault. This command runs automatically when you call [[generate]].

## Usage

```bash
./kiln clean
```

## Flags

You can customize which directory is targeted using the flags below.

| Flag       | Short version | Default value | Description                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--output` | `-o`          | `"./public"`  | The path to the directory that should be removed.             |
| `--log`    | `-l`          | `info`        | Sets the log level. You can choose between `info` or `debug`. |

> [!danger] Irreversible Action 
> This command **permanently deletes** the specified directory and all of its contents.
> 
> Please ensure you do not inadvertently point the `--output` flag at your source folder or a directory containing important files, as they cannot be recovered.
