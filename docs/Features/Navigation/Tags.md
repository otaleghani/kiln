# # Tags

While folders represent rigid structure, tags represent fluid associations. Kiln leverages Obsidian's tagging system to create cross-cutting collections of content that ignore folder boundaries.

## Dynamic Aggregation
For every unique tag found in your vault (e.g., `#philosophy` or `#project-alpha`), Kiln automatically generates a dedicated page.

- **Tag Pages:** These pages serve as dynamic hubs. They list every single note that contains that specific tag.
- **Cross-Folder Discovery:** Because tags work across directories, a tag page gives you an instant collection of related ideas regardless of where the files actually live (e.g., clicking `#urgent` shows tasks from both your `Work` and `Personal` folders).

## Graph Integration
Tags are fully integrated citizens of your site's visualization tools.

- **Graph Nodes:** Tags appear as distinct nodes in your graphs.
- **Visualizing Connections:** This is powerful for seeing hidden connections. You might see that the tag `#productivity` acts as a bridge connecting your `Journal` folder to your `Reading List`, revealing patterns in your thinking that folders alone might hide.
