# Table of Contents

For every note in your vault, Kiln automatically generates a **Table of Contents (TOC)** located in the **Right Sidebar**.

This navigation aid is constructed by scanning the headers (`# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`) within your Markdown file. It provides readers with a quick overview of the document structure and allows them to jump to specific sections instantly.

## Features

### Hierarchical Structure
The TOC preserves the nesting of your document.
* **H1** headers are top-level items.
* **H2** headers are indented.
* **H3** headers are further indented.

This visual hierarchy makes it easy to scan complex documents and understand the relationship between sections.
