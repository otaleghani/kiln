**Kiln** is a static site generator designed specifically for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It takes your Markdown vault—images, canvases, graphs, and math included—and "bakes" it into a highly optimized, interactive HTML website. 

Take a look at the [documentation](https://kiln.talesign.com/) to get started.
